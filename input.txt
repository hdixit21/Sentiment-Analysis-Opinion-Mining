Sentence1##Omg excellent once again. My daughter took me as part of my birthday gift along with seeing  color purple play. Food was once again delicious   Excellent service. Only thing I hated was been seated in a 2 seater squeezed in. When we had to get up I had to suck in my belly the people next to us got us and dropped the salt and pepper shakers. Wasn't rushed on a Sunday night but left over stuffed. Thank you for delicious food.##food:1~service:1
Sentence2##Food excellent. Service excellent. Noisy as hear. Expect that nothing you can do. Had to wait 45 minutes but worth it .##food:1~service:1~ambiance:-1
Sentence3##Amazing family style restaurant! tortellini and chicken Parmesan are to die for. Make sure to come with an appetite the servings are no joke.##food:1~meat:1~place:1
Sentence4##Excellent food but you must order family style portion. Not good when one of you is a pescatarian and the other only eats beef and chicken. Didn't realize this until we were seated and $117 later I was stuck with a ton of leftovers that went into the trash.##food:1
Sentence5##Came here on Christmas day and it was AMAZING!!! One of the best restaurants I've tried in NY! The service and food were so on point! I was so impressed.  We had the Shrimp and Artichoke Oreganata, Tony's Arugula Salad, Linguini with Seafood (marinara) and a few desserts. The Very Berry was cute and came in a martini glass!##food:1~service:1~meat:1
Sentence6##We were recommendation to try this place for authentic Italian food. It's family style & pretty cool looking inside & was quite busy. I ordered one of the specialties of the day which was shrimp & calamari grilled with their special seasoning & sauce $25. It was ok...very bland & so I asked for extra marinara & red peppers to spice it up a bit. It was nothing I would need to visit them again to get. My girlfriend ordered a salmon dish that was accompanied by spaghetti. The salmon was actually really good. (just the salmon) an another girlfriend order shrimp scampi for $28 & was brought just shrimp in sauce...she was expecting pasta, but was told that would be an additional charge being scampi is ah la carte. Nothing else needs to be said....Oh, an our server was nice.##food:1~ambiance:1~people:1
Sentence7##Resturant is family style so if this is not your thing then don't go. We ordered Calamari Fritti which was wonderful some of the best I have ever had very tender. Additionally, we ordered the Roquefort salad which was abundant but ordinary. when I go back I'll sample a different salad selection. For an entree we ordered Veal Marsala which was excellent some of the best spinach I have ever tasted. For dessert we ordered and split a tartuffo which was great as well.##food:1~meat:1
Sentence8##Very Authentic! Very very family friendly, Our waiter wasn't very nice he was rushing us out the whole time , Never refilled or waters, I asked for chicken Alfredo he said they had it then he charged me for the full place of Alfredo for $27 and charged and additional plate of grilled chicken without telling me and just just poured it on the Alfredo. Great place not the best service from here.##food:1~service:-1~place:1
Sentence9##We went for lunch, and there were certain menu items that were lunch portion sizes, which worked out for us perfectly! Started with the Prosciutto & Burrata, so delicious! There were some roasted red peppers and olives on the plate, wish they put more of the Crostinis on the plate, but no big deal. I got the Black linguini seafood, my friend go the ravioli. The food came out pretty timely for how busy they were. The pasta was cooked perfectly, great flavor! It was my first time trying black linguini, but I was glad I did! Our server did a great job and got us out without taking too long. Will definitely go back!##food:1~service:1~people:1 
Sentence10##Family style Italian with family size portion. Waitstaff seems attentive even though the place is packed. But it is V-Day right? Ok, we have placed our order for a shrimp appetizer, egg parmigiana, and sausages and meatballs and a glass oh Sangria !. Food was good and plentiful.. We enjoyed!##food:1~people:1 
Sentence11##”Great traditional Italian Food Family Style. We have ordered take out for years. This weekend we held a family reunion at their 43rd St location! Appetizers of Baked Clams, shrimp, mozz, all hot and delicious! Chicken Parm is on point! Just what you expect!!  Chicken Marsala drenched in mushrooms. Pass on the eggplant  Penne a la Vodka  is a favorite as well as the baked Neopolitan Ziti. Caesar salad with home made croutons is delish. Our favorite is the Strawberry Shortcake for dessert.... Drizzled with strawberries atop a mountain of shortcake with layers of strawberry ice cream.. Whipped cream on top  enough for 5 people. They have a special Tartufo... White chocolate outside and mango & raspberry sorbet inside.. A must after a heavy meal! Great for large groups... They have an enormous space downstairs. Wait staff know how to handle big parties."##food:1
Sentence12##This place has all the trappings of a terrible restaurant, but a good case study in don't judge a book by its' cover! Right in midtown... huge Italian place... full of tourists... static winelist.... had to wait 1/2 an hour even with a reservation...BUT... the food was actually pretty good, not going to your Italian grandmother's place good but very solid! Tried two bottles of wine, one was meh the other pretty good.  Service was pretty good for the guy being so overworked. I wanted to dislike the place but they did a nice job, a midtown place I can actually recommend - bookmark this!##food:1~service:1~place:1~drinks:1
Sentence13##Nice ambiance and a perfect place to bring a large party. The meals are all sharing size, so I wouldn't say it's ideal for a dinner date. The food was good, and it was a typical New York Italian restaurant in its style. The Albanian waiter was very nice. Id say it's nice to bring the family but I'd opt to go somewhere else for a dinner date.##food:1~people:1
Sentence14##ABSOLUTELY INCREDIBLE! We made a reservation and they must have heard the date wrong, because by the time we arrived, they told us it was for next weekend. They were quick to make room for us though, and we had a beer at the bar while waiting. I will remember the following events for the rest of my life. The bread was baked by Mother Theresa herself, it was warm and buttery and flaky, it was everything bread should be. Our waiter recommended the sangria and the chicken special, both were better than anything I've ever eaten. I have not stopped thinking about this meal, and I never will!##food:1~meat:1~drinks:1
Sentence15##Great food, great waitress excellent service  but loud. The chicken parm is top notch. These are family sharing portions.  Our waitress was a former actress/acting student and was an excellent accompanying help for our night on Broadway show.##food:1~service:1~meat:1~people:1
Sentence16##Their penne vodka is the best thing on the menu hands down. Only disappointing factor is that it's stuck right by Times Square so there is a bunch of traffic/people. I highly recommend making reservations because it gets pretty packed quickly. Also try to tiramisu that can be shared with the whole table. ##food:1
Sentence17##”Nothing crazy here with food , just an average Italian place with a lot of hype.A good thing their portions is huge, so that can be s plus for a lot of people."##food:0~place:0
Sentence18##Went for breakfast. Food was nothing special. Atmosphere was pretty great. Story has it, everyone that does not make it big in NY comes here to work as a waiter. They sing really well, and the entertainment is good. But the food is pretty average and the coffee below average.##food:0~ambiance:1
Sentence19##God ! Where do I start !! I love this place, where else in NYC can you receive such good food at such a good price and still make your Broadway Show!! Tony's will always accommodate you and your hungry guests, the food is amazing the service is just as good!! Try the frozen Bellini its absolutely delicious!##food:1~service:1~place:1~price:1
Sentence20##It's your classic family style Italian restaurant, complete with the Time Square ambiance and decor. We came in for lunch as a party of four and got a few different options and were very happy with what we got. The portions are very generous, the food comes quickly, the staff is attentive and friendly and best of all, it tastes great. It's a little pricey but on par with the area. Overall, bring your appetite and a decent sized amount of people because you'll leave full and happy.##food:1~service:1~ambiance:1~people:1
Sentence21##Growing up in an Italian house hold this family style resturaunt is perfect! We just came here for a Holiday party and it's got great taste and flavor for appetizers, entrees, and desserts. This place did not disappoint.##food:1~place:1
Sentence22##Top notch place! Came here with a group of 20 before a Broadway show. Incredible food, attentive and friendly service and reasonable price/value. This place gives Carmine's a run for its money! Will be back again, for sure!##food:1~service:1~price:1
Sentence23##We hit up Tony's after Les Mis.  After a day of flying, and then a fabulous show, we needed eats! Decided on the Spaghetti & Meatballs.  It completely hit the spot!  And the service was great.##food:1~service:1
Sentence24##Came here on our first night in NY.  I have to say it   this was by far the best Italian food in town ( besides little Italy).  Plates are huge so you can share .  We had calamari and vodka penne pasta ... Amazing!!   The service was excellent.  Our waitress was super nice ( I didn't get her name but she had blonde hair).   I totally recommend this place... 2 thumbs up.##food:1~service:1~people:1
Sentence25##Came here on 2/14/16 and was running 30 minutes late for a 7 pm reservation. Being as though it was Valentines day I was for sure our table was given up. I called while I was on the train and was told not to worry they would hold our table. We arrived and were seated immediately. The hostess, waiter, everyone was extremely nice and food was crazy good. Not one complaint. My favorite Italian restaurant hands down.##food:1~service:1~people:1
Sentence26##Outstanding!  Seriously this is the best Italian food I have ever had. Super prices/value.  Family-style service makes for economical dining at this establishment. Quality, service, atmosphere are all outstanding.  Be afraid of portion size. If it says it serves 2-3 you may be underestimating how many villages can be fed off a single plate. Highly recommend. I will make it a point to visit on my next NYC vacation.##food:1~service:1~ambiance:1
Sentence27##Wow!- this place surprised my taste buds.  The service was great, but the food was even better. We shared a sashimi salad; and it was really good and fresh.  We also had the cucumber special, it has no rice, but has crab meat, spicy tuna, salmon, and avocado; very good! And lastly we shared a pan fried seafood Lo-mein; we added back choi and it was one of best dishes I had! Definitely will be back! Never thought of mixing Chinese and Japanese food; but was an excellent combo! Very yummy! Sorry no pics this time; but will do next time. P.S. Prices were reasonable for the amount of food you get!##food:1~service:1~meat:1
Sentence28##Amazing food and atmosphere. Aaron made the meal fun and extraordinary.  Definitely a worthwhile experience.##food:1~ambiance:1
Sentence29##We went on a Friday night without a reservation, table for two. They told us half an hour to forty minutes, but we waited an hour. It was mobbed with people. When we finally got our food, we found out why. Wow, was it good. The bread they served I think was the best bread I've ever tasted. We had the stuffed mushrooms for an appetizer, and it was out of this world delish. Then I sopped up the sauce left over with the bread--I could have eaten nothing else for dinner and been perfectly happy. We ordered the ravioli (it's family style, so one dish is plenty for two people) and it was quite good. Highly recommended.##food:1
Sentence30##Eggplant dish was good and calamari dish was cooked to perfection. Seemed like a touristy Italian restaurant - try and get seated downstairs (less noisy).##food:1~meat:1
Sentence31##Definitely come around 5ish. Place gets crowded and noise level is high.  We had the stuffed mushrooms, it was to die for. For the main course, I had the Penne ala Vodka which was oh soooooo good, portions were huge, could feed 3 people. And for dessert, we had Tartuffo, which is Vanilla ice cream, with a cherry in the center. Covered in a shell made of chocolate and nuts. Was the most amazing thing I've had in a long time. I would definitely come back.##food:1
Sentence32##This place serves some of the best Spanish food on the block. Fresh ingredients and savory selections make this a hidden gem in Journal Square. I am a huge fan of their tacos, you can never go wrong getting a few.##food:1
Sentence33##This place is as good as it gets for cheap quick fresh food.  Don't judge it based on the decor as there is nothing to see here inside or out. But their food is out of this world delicious and fresh. Every time we go we always try a whole bunch of different tacos and tortas.  Our stomach is never big enough. The service is always really friendly despite some language barriers. Between our broken high school Spanish and the chefs broken English in a little bit pointing here and there, we get our order in and right.  And sometimes when order is not right we just go with it as is usually delicious and we are always in the mood for a culinary adventure surprise. So if you're the mood for cheap fresh authentic Mexican food, just come on by and sit down!.##food:1~service:1~ambiance:-1~price:1
Sentence34##LOVE this authentic Mexican restaurant!!! Great food and nice customer service! I love their breakfast options and arroz con leche is out of this world!.##food:1~service:1~place:1
Sentence35##This is a nice place with some nice food. It's small and dingy. It looks like it's managed by a nice Mexican familia. Tacos are lovely but portions are less compared to chipotle etc. love the green sauce that they have. They are cash only(ouch!) but I guess that's what makes it economical. It's worth eating here. But there is hardly any place to sit and eat, so I would suggest a take-out.##food:1~place:1
Sentence36##Excellent hole in the wall taqueria! Was biking exploring new places not downtown and stumbled upon this place. Horcheta and carnitas tacos were perfect! Will be coming here more often.##food:1
Sentence37##The tacos were awesome! I never thought I would find a legit Mexican food place in the east coast other than Mexico / California. My favorite was the beef tongue tacos!##food:1~meat:1
Sentence38##I’ve lived in Jersey City for almost 10 years and never tried this place which I pass almost every day! Authentic Mexican food right in the corner without having to go to downtown! Fast delivery.##food:1~service:1
Sentence39##Been eyeing this place up for some time now, got a chance to try it today and I wasn't disappointed. Got the Carnitas and the Asada tacos AMAZING!!! I'll definitely be back again. And again. And again!!!.##food:1
Sentence40##Great tacos but somehow average burritos. Good prices. Decor nonexistent. Friendly lady who works there speaks broken English. More like 3.5 stars. Stop by for takeout if you're in the area.##food:1~ambiance:-1~price:1
Sentence41##Amazing tacos, great atmosphere, great prices. Hope you have time for a vacation, because this place takes you away to mexico. The food is prepared right in front of you and you practically need a translator to order. Everything from the side sauces, grilled tortillas, and various meats exceeds expectations.##food:1~meat:1~ambiance:1~price:1
Sentence42##This place is very authentic. Simple menu, amazing ingredients, super friendly staff. I just have to mention, EXTREMELY FAST delivery. I am so happy I found this place.##service:1~people:1~place:1
Sentence43##I love this place. Good food, cheap, good service and delivery (even tho min. delivery is $30, they got our food to us in an excellent amount of time). The burritos are the shiz. Get the burritos.##food:1~service:1~place:1~price:1
Sentence44##”I had heard good things about this place and ordered delivery from here last week. (Min. charge $12, btw) The delivery was prompt and the food definitely didn't disappoint. Delicious, hearty tacos. I ordered the carnitas, al pastor, and pollo. My favorite was definitely the Carnitas. The meat was tender and cooked to perfection. The pollo was a bit bland for my liking. And I loved Al Pastor as it was spicy and I'm a huge advocate of spice. The tacos were a bit dry, but were fine once you added the salsa provided with them. (salsa verde, that also comes with the chips. salsa rojo - proceed with caution, it's quite spicy) I also ordered a side of chips and salsa just to meet the min. delivery charge. Not the best chips/salsa I've had, but pretty good."##food:1~service:1~meat:1
Sentence45##This is really one legit Mexican joint. I ordered their Lengua (beef tongue), Carnita and Pollo tacos...and boy was I blown away. The meat is tender, succulent and savory. Their tacos taste home made, I simply love independent run eateries serving wholesome tasty and unpretentious food...will definitely be back for other items on their menu.##food:1~meat:1
Sentence46##This place is awesome! They deliver! They are real Mexican authentic tacos! Portions are great ! They have a great variety of different meats! And prices are reasonable!##food:1~meat:1~place:1~price:1
Sentence47##This is the best cheap eat in Jersey City. It's rare to come across a restaurant that serves authentic Mexican food on the east coast. Love the pineapple pork burrito!!##food:1~price:1
Sentence48##Excellent food, authentic Mexican! Best steak tacos I've ever had. And the people are very friendly.##food:1~meat:1~people:1
Sentence49##If you're looking for real authentic Mexican tacos this is the place! The women who took my order was accommodating and very nice. I love their beef tacos  and the lengua being a close second.For the first time I also had "horchata"  (sorry if incorrectly misspelled) a Mexican drink. Overall great food.##food:1~meat:1~people:1
Sentence50##Delicious and cheap food, nice friendly people, great place. I know I will be a regular here.##food:1~people:1~place:1~price:1
Sentence51##Best thin crust pizza in the city. Shroomtown all the way. I can literally eat this pizza every day. Downside, it is not filling due to it being exquisitely thin, so the price adds up if you want to order enough. If they don't deliver to you try their sister restaurants Tappo or Vezzo.##food:1~price:1
Sentence52##Decent place- would recommend going during happy hour to get a free bottle of wine with a pizza. I would recommend the mushroom pizza and the cheesy garlic bread. Not bad at all. The sister restaurants include vezzo in midtown and luzzos in EV. All the great and have great pizzas. Fun spot, near a bunch of bars to go afterwards. Luzzos is probably my favorite, but this would be my second choice##food:1~place:1
Sentence53##such a cozy restaurant! I have been to Posto couple of times and I think Classica and Big pineapple are the best. You can pick two choices (not sure if you can pick more than 2 choices). I like that the crust is very thin, which u can taste more cheese and less calories than thick crust. Garlic bread with cheese was good, but I wouldn't order that before my main pizza comes... because it made me so full that I could only eat one and a half slice of the pizza and had to put the rest of them into a togo box... overall, I really liked this restaurant and will keep visiting !##food:1~place:1
Sentence54##330pm-630pm Happy hour - buy a bottle of wine and get a 16 inch pizza for free!  Toppings are extra.  This is an amazing deal for two people.  Best thin crust pizza I've ever had with the best buzz I've ever had.  I listened to the other reviewers, got shroomtown, and was far from disappointed.##food:1
Sentence55##One of the best pizza spots I've been too. They give you a pretty big variety of toppings to put on your pizza. I like thin crust pizza and that's exactly what you get from this place. Try the cheesy garlic bread as an appetizer you won't be disappointed##food:1
Sentence56##They say that Eskimos have dozens, or even hundreds, of words for snow. New Yorkers should have just as many for pizza; choosing pizza in NYC is dependent on the situation. There are those places you go to with your homies to drink bud light, watch the game, and nosh on fluffy crust every topping pizza. Posto isn't that place. It's the place you go to when you want to enjoy a perfectly crispy thin crust, minimal topping pizza, paired with a nice glass of Williamette Valley Pinot Noir. I have room in my life for both. You might think that a candle lit dinner at Posto is much more of a hassle, it isn't. The wait is never bad, and the prices are very reasonable.One word of advice: eat the pizza in a timely manner. It's easy to lose track of time when you're enjoying wine and conversation, but it's a fact that thin crust pizza gets cold fast, especially in the non-summer months.##food:1~price:1
Sentence57##Best pizza I've ever had, I've been coming here for years. The only thing to watch is that their olives  (in pizza or the greek salad) quite often have pits in them.##food:1
Sentence58##Most awesome ultra thin crust pizza place in nyc. The mushroom pizza is delicious. Happy hour goes like this: free pizza with a bottle of vino. Very small place and intimate atmosphere. Many pizzas to choose from and nice selection of wine. No reservations offered.Thin like cracker pizza!##food:1~ambiance:1~place:-1
Sentence59##Pretty good for what it specializes in -  very thin crust personal pizzas that are not too much nor too little for a normal meal. I also had the quinoa and avocado salad, which was quite delicious, and very generous with the feta and avocado. Great staff and friendly service in a small and dimly lit, yet casual, hideout.##food:1~service:1~people:1
Sentence60##This was my first time having pizza in New York and it didn't disappoint.  Its been a while since I've had Posto and I'm still thinking about it.  We got two large thin crust pizza's and it was enough for 6 of us, 5 of them being small eaters.  I thought that the pizza tasted great and the fresh ingredients really came through.  We custom ordered our pizza's so I cannot comment on the regular available pizzas.  But from what I was told, the Shroomtown is probably the best pizza that they have.##food:1
Sentence61##great pizza, got the veggie pizza and one with parma ham - both were excellent and very uniquie (crust is unlike other NY pizzas, so thin its kind of crispy, but still holds the weight of the excellent toppings). Garlic bread was tasty but the bread quality was just ok. They let you do half and half for pizza options when you pick a large. the house pinot grigio is barely wine imo and I know next to nothing about wines, so either get a non happy hour wine or stick to beer (or be healthy and have neither). staff were very nice.##food:1~people:1
Sentence62##terrible service. you guys need to be nicer and hire more staff. this is terrible. wait over 15 minutes to get your bill and another 10 to get a drink refill. The chipotle pizza with spicy marinara is good.Lunch special is $10 for small salad + personal plain pizza. Add toppings $3 each. add spicy marinara $1 the sandwiches suck.##food:1~service:-1
Sentence63##Best pizza in the neighborhood!  It is part of the Vezzo pizza empire in the city. You can make your own personal or large pies, plus the salads are delicious. I love the El Greco pizza (Greek salad on top of pizza) and shroomtown (mushroom truffle goodness). While they do deliver, they are not on seamless and do not take cash. Nevertheless this is my go to dinner delivery spot and the best kept secret in the neighborhood.##food:1
Sentence64##Got here on a Saturday at 1p, and luckily (for me) the place was half empty. I ordered their signature pizza: the shroomtown. If you like ridiculously thin crust pizza, this is the place for you. It looked more like a tarte flambee than a real pizza, but it was pretty good nonetheless. It was very crunchy, so don't expect anything soft or chewy. I prefer deep-dish pizza, but this one was good, and the mushroom plenty!##food:1
Sentence65##Came with 6 people, they accommodated us at a nice table in the back. Two of us ordered paninos and the rest ordered pizza and salads. The pizza and salads came out with good timing but the paninos took so long. The food was okay, nothing remarkable. I do appreciate a really thin crispy pizza, and their pizza is like that. I do recommend the lemonade (unsweetened), and the prosciutto wrap appetizer (forget the name) but its super good.##food:1~service:-1
Sentence66##My biggest beef with pizza is often how messy it gets. Grease drips off the cheese- and sauce-laden pie as you try to maneuver it delicately into your mouth, hoping that your teeth doesn't string along only the topping, leaving a soggy naked crust in your fingers. Not at Posto. The pizza is crisp-thin, yet is malleable enough to bite off at exactly where you want it to separate and not shatter into a dozen pizza pieces. I got a plain cheese and marinara personal pizza with pepperoni topping, which net out to be $10.50. It is a little pricey for the amount of food, but if you are seeking thin crust pizza this hits the spot. I was also impressed by the Rostello, which was mozzarella, red pepper and lettuce wrapped in prosciutto and dressed with a basil garlic mayo-esque sauce. It looked like low-carb Italian sushi to me. The rolls were bite sized, and it was well proportioned with its ingredients of cheese vegetables and meat.##food:1
Sentence67##I seriously loved the mushroom pizza. Perfectly crispy thin crust and piled high with all sorts of shrooms. The truffle flavor was so strong! We shared that and a salad for two and had a few slices left over. Just as good the next day after a quick reheat in the skillet! It has kind of a divey old school feel with dim lighting and dark wood, a nice chill place to hang out, not necessarily a first date place. Service was average. Would definitely come back for the pizza or order in from here.##food:1
Sentence68##Thin crust pizza is absolutely delish! Ideal place for a quick cozy family gathering. Staff is very nice and most important quick! We also tried ravioli and salads. Would highly recommend pizza and ravioli but salads not that significant.##food:1~service:1~people:1
Sentence69##My husband's a pizza snob and Posto def sit at the top of his list.  We try to go once a week and have had shroomtown and meatball classic, which are both excellent when we crave something different, but the best is still Classica, simple yet ridiculously delicious (super thin crispy crust, not doughy).Salads are fresh and generously sized and the wine list is very reasonably priced.  Posto's got us as fans for life.##service:1~drinks:1
Sentence70##Great food, nice service, razor-thin crust, the only thing I didn't like was the fact that it was a nice classy restaurant, with crappy bachata music playing. It just made everything not feel right.##food:1~service:1~music:-1
Sentence71##I can't believe I used to live around the neighborhood for 4 years and never tried Posto until now.  I have always pass by it but just never went in.  The place is small but the pizza are so good.  What I love about it is the super thin crust.  It's almost like a crispy tortilla layer which in my mind, it's a healthy carb friendly pizza.   With the super thin crust, this pizza does not leave any room for a sauceless and toppingless crust edge that's left to throw out.  This is definitely up there with Motorino and Luzzo's that's in the same hood.##food:1~place:-1
Sentence72##Best pizza in the neighborhood!  It is part of the Vezzo pizza empire in the city. You can make your own personal or large pies, plus the salads are delicious. I love the El Greco pizza (Greek salad on top of pizza) and shroomtown (mushroom truffle goodness). While they do deliver, they are not on seamless and do not take cash. Nevertheless this is my go to dinner delivery spot and the best kept secret in the neighborhood.##food:1
Sentence73##If you want thin crust pizza, this is your place. One of the best in town. Crispy to the bite with busting flavors of the marinara sauce and fresh cheese.##food:1
Sentence74##I've been going to Posto for many many years and have verbally  recommended  it a hundred times over.  I've been to Mystic Pizza and several other well known pizza places all over the U.S.. My favorite pizza however is Posto's meat lover  special. My absolute favorite pizza. Posto has a bar and it's a small but cozy restaurant.##fod:1~place:1
Sentence75##Pretty tasty pizza if you enjoy flatbread. I'm not the biggest fan of the type but Posto does have a really great selection of flavors and I've enjoyed every slice I've tried. This place is in my neighborhood so it's an easy grab for dinner or lunch on the weekend.##food:1
Sentence76##Sat at bar and had a great service experience, my server was Trinidad and he was a show. Because they sell all entrees family style they offer a few items single size at the bar. I had the veal parmigian sub and caesar salad. The salad was one of the best I've had. The veal was a little tough and uneventful. I ordered the chianti. It's  Carmine's private label and I think he should keep it even more private, undrinkable.##service:1~food:1~people:1
Sentence77##We were on vacation from Florida and Georgia. We were told to try this place by many people who live in New York. It was great, packed but great. Our waiter to us it all came family style but when the food came it was so much food. We had three people and still had enough food for 4 more people. We hate to waste it so we gave it to a homeless women. If you go to New York and go to time Square,  you must try this place. Our waiter Lindemberg R , did a great job  and was very friendly. It was a great end to our day in New York.##people:1~food:1
Sentence78##Can't say enough good things about this franchise! They serve family style portions, so keep that in mind when ordering. The rigatoni with sausage and broccoli is the best around. I've tried the steak and seafood/linguini dish and they are all excellent. Prices aren't that bad for what you get, you will not leave here hungry. I've never had a bad meal here. They get packed during peak meal hours, but I find I can often get a seat at the bar if I don't feel like waiting.##meat:1~price:0
Sentence79##Great food! Awesome service, the portions are huuuuge and I love the decor!! My family and I had an awesome time.##food:1~service:1~ambiance:1
Sentence80##Very happy with our visit. We stopped by while on vacation with 2 young kids. Staff was super friendly and got us seated as soon as possible. Had manicotti and ravioli. Both were AWESOME. Wish we had saved room for dessert. It looked great. Actually... wish our group was bigger so I could have tried more things off the menu. Everything looked amazing.##food:1~people:1 
Sentence81##One of my colleagues recommended this place and it was absolutely amazing ! The food is to die for and the portions sizes are big. The waiter was attentive and the was not long. The penne pasta in marinara sauce with veggies was the best thing i have ever tasted ! Although it is on the pricier side it is definitely a place you and your family need to visit when your in the city.##food:1~place:1~price:1
Sentence82##Okay, it's definitely a tourist trap & if your party doesn't like the same entree or dessert, you'll be screwed since the portion sizes are HUGE.  I'm not kidding.  It might help if you have a reservation but we got seating fairly quickly on a weeknight without major issues.  No complaints from anyone on this & the staff is very helpful and attentive. It's probably one of those places you should go to at least once so you can say you've done it. As long as I was with someone who liked the same stuff I did, I'd come back.##people:1
Sentence83##By family portions they mean it. Portions are HUGE. Although service wasn't great there were about 6 servers standing around right next to us but it took a while before someone asked if we wanted a drink. Then right after we ordered we wanted to change our server was pissed at us. Food is good, but not amazing. Plain italian food and huge portions##food:1~service:-1
Sentence84##This is a great restaurant to go specially with big parties or families.the food here is great, the service seems to be great too, and tables are big enough to accommodate big parties, which is a plus. It's nothing incredibly special, but it's worth a try##food:1~service:1
Sentence85##Couldn't give them more stars if I tried. Getting a reservation is difficult unless you book it far in advance but it's SO worth the wait! Food is delicious and so fresh. The service is always great and staff is always friendly and attentive. Definitely a great family atmosphere. Prices are pretty reasonable for family style dining. Love this place!##food:1~service:1~people:1~place:1~price:1
Sentence86##I like the old school charm of the decor, especially the the many wire chandeliers up top. I think that's the selling point of this place, along with it's huge portions of family-style dishes. Everything is family style so I think this place is better to suited to at least four ppl a table. The Southern Italian food is actually rather mediocre. The stuffed mushrooms were decent and the meatballs with spaghetti was okay. Really not special or especially delicious. That said, after eating here, I feel like I could burst.##food:-1
Sentence87##Carmines is THE BEST Italian restaurant that I have ever been to in MY LIFE!!! The ambiance,  the service, THE FOOD was fantastic!!!! The portions were large (family size) ....well worth the price.My friend and I sat at the bar.... the lady bartender was very patient and hospitable..... she didn't even cringe when we asked for cheese on our meatballs (which is non traditional).....the sicilian soda was a treat!!! I most certainly enjoyed everything about Carmines!! If you're  in time square NYC...it's a must that you go!!!! #authentic##food:1~service:1~ambiance:1
Sentence88##We had the Sunday 4 pasta special and Ceasar salad.  The portion was a good size for 6.  We had plenty of left over.  Food was delicious and tasty.  The lasagna with the Sunday pasta was vegetable lasagna.  You won't be disappointed with the Sunday pasta dish!##food:1
Sentence89##I've been to this location twice on a Saturday in the last 3 weeks and haven't been disappointed yet! The atmosphere is busy but still nice! We started with the anti-pasta cold starter. It's not on the menu so you may have to ask for it....I've had this twice and it's so delicious and could be a meal on its own if you're not looking for too much to eat. The men we were with ordered that huge steak both times we have gone... The garlic topping they finish it with is a perfect balance. We've also had the spinach, vodka pasta and meatballs... I highly recommend them all. Of course we had left overs (more than half) since the portions are family style and huge. This place is starting to be our regular place every time we visit NY.##food:1~ambiance:1
Sentence90##After reading all the good reviews by my fellow yelpers here, we decided to check out this place. The place itself is huge, however there was about 20 minute wait before we got a table for two on a second floor. The server was very nice to us and walked us through the menu. We ended up ordering Hot Antipasto, which is like a sampler, and a lasagna. Everything was delicious, however people keep in mind that portions are huge, I mean really HUGE! We ended up taking more food with us than we actually ate there. Next time me and my girlfriend go there we just gonna stick to one entree. Overall it is a great Italian restaurant! Will be definitely coming back again!##people:1
Sentence91##The most authentic family style Italian food you will ever devour. Once a year we go for my aunts birthday because it's her favorite place and I swear I never want to leave. Best things to try (in my opinion): Caesar salad with or without anchovies, the calamari, and the penne alla vodka. BEST THINGS ON THE MENU BY FAR.  It is all served family style so make sure to go with a group of people because you and one more person won't do it. It's also expensive, but you get what you pay for and believe me its worth it.##place:1~price:-1
Sentence92##Here's another place I was pleasantly surprised by- Carmine's.  It seems like it's going to be the ultimate tourist trap, but DANG- this was some pretty good food.  I was with a large party, so we shared: mussels and clams, veal, eggplant, calamari and Tartufi.  I have to say- all of it was very good. The waitstaff was on TOP of it, always attentive, but not annoying and the space was really great##food:1~people:1
Sentence93##Went here on a Wednesday night and still had  to wait more than an hour for a table.  It is a very big restaurant, but there are so many people that come here. I am sorry, but I do not understand the hype.  Maybe it's their family style theme and the huge portion of food that comes with every order, but the food for me was just not up to par.  I got the penne a la vodka which I showered with cheese, salt, and pepper.  I have honestly had better.  If anyone else can recommend a dish that is worth the hype please do let me know.  I would like to try it.##food:-1
Sentence94##Come hungry or come with a group no less than 4!  Food is rustic and great.  Service is friendly and prompt. There is no messing around at this place. You go to eat. Great place for a large group.##food:1~people:1
Sentence95##Family restaurant. Very big portion. Italian food. I ordered the seafood pasta with red sauce. It was delicious. I recommend sharing for four people.##food:1
Sentence96##Great service and the food was amazing!!!! The food is served family style so if your party is less than 4 I recommend dining before 3PM so you can order from the lunch menu. My husband and I ordered spaghetti with meatballs from the lunch menu and it was more than enough. The bread basket was also amazing!!!##food:1~service:1
Sentence97##Wow.........thats is worst service ever i experienced......... I wont go back ever! Hostess ! She was mean to me she thought i didnt want to pay my bar tab before sitting at a table for dinner! I thought its gonna be included in my check! She gave me attitude like that! They cant just say nicely ?! Damn horrible ! I dont get it how that kind of person could find job make customer have bad time !! I have no words to say anymore its just terrible and horrible sucks !!!!!!!##service:-1~people:1
Sentence98##Good service and huge portions, overall very good place to visit while near Times Square.  Our waiter was friendly and prompt, the drinks were kept full and the cocktails were tasty.  The lasagne was ok, not great, and the shrimp scampi was very well seasoned, but the shrimp were over-cooked.  I'd give it another try on my next visit.##food:1~service:1~people:1
Sentence99##Carmine's is such a wonderful place for groups! Their dishes are huge. We ordered Frutti di Mare with linguini and fried calamari but I doubt the 3 of us made any damage to it. The calamari was AMAZING. Pretty pricey at $30 but the plate was huge. The Frutti di Mare had so much seafood in it too. We went around 12pm on a weekday and it was empty at first but filled up quickly around 1pm-2pm. I would like to go back for a creamy pasta dish next time!##meat:1
Sentence100##Absolutely love my experience here! We had dinner here on a Wednesday evening and we did not have reservations but we were seated immediately. The staff here was great and the food and environment was superb! We ordered the ceasar salad and shrimp parmesan with linguine pasta w/red sauce... DELICIOUS!##food:1~ambiance:1~people:1~place:1
Sentence101##My husband went there for lunch yesterday for our anniversary, we got ravioli's with their red sauce, it was out of this world. We can't wait to come back!! Service was on point!!##food:1~service:1
Sentence102##If you're  in from out of town and looking for Italian food, come here first!! Yeah, go visit little Italy and get a Cannoli from Palermo's (Oh My God!) and maybe do lunch at Angelo's (nice place, good Chicken Parm), but for heavens' sake - for dinner, YOU HAVE TO GO TO CARMINE'S !!!!!The ambiance = fantastic. Wait staff = very helpful and professional. The food = well, all I had to say at the end of the night was; "That was the best meal I've ever had in my life".##food:1~ambiance:1~people:1~place:1~service:1
Sentence103##The food is family-style, comes in enormous portions, and are pricey (but it's NYC, so you should expect it). Minimal beer list, a few fun cocktails, and a small wine list, but the menu is pretty extensive and the food is wonderful.Something that bugged me during our visit: a party of 3 of us ordered the daily special salad, and it was a verifiable MOUNTAIN of food - enough for a table of 8-10. It would've been nice to get a warning, or offer a half portion, or something. It was also $30+... for a salad...Anyway, it's a staple, Italian, NYC restaurant.##food:1~price:-1~drinks:-1
Sentence104##Went to Times Square to get last minute Broadway show tickets. That didn't happen but we ended up at Carmine's. Didn't have a reservation so we're told a minimum 1 hour wait. We got seated in about 40 minutes. This was a busy Sunday night, so the quick service was appreciated. It was an early anniversary celebration. Our staff was helpful and pleasant. We ordered the fish dish and a penne pasta in marinara sauce with veggies. Both were amazing. The portion sizes are huge. We got no appetizers, 2 entree dishes and no desserts for 4 adults and we couldn't finish.##food:1~service:1~meat:1~people:1
Sentence105##Stopped in here last night with some friends that were in town. It was so convenient being in Times Square and all. We ordered some oysters and a Ceasar salad to start. Eggplant Parmigiana was amazing. All our dishes were very well cooked and presented. The atmosphere is very intimate and classic New York City. I've eaten here before a few times and the food is always yummy. The pasta dishes are authentic Italian, made from scratch. My friends loved it. Thanks for a great dinner.##food:1~ambiance:1
Sentence106##Went there for the 1st time this week.Very slow service, okay food.Not going back. Ever.##food:1~service:0
Sentence107##The food is not bad, in fact had it been cheaper, it would be really a good value.  The service has a little attitude, but that's fine as the place is on the hottest block by the mall in that part of the downtown. They can sure afford that's. Standard bar offerings regarding liquor, beer, wine, and drinks. Nothing to write home abouthome.##food:1~service:-1
Sentence108##They make a variety of pizzas, and they all do the job. Margherita. Pepperoni. Buffalo Chicken. Plain. Even Hawaiian. Quick delivery, and plenty of plates and napkins. Great service.##service:1
Sentence109##Its a OK ambiance.. I preferred sitting in the patio more than in the restaurant. The interior was too jazzy for me.The service is OK.  The food is OK but not worth the price. We had ordered pizza and Roasted chicken picatta . The chicken picatta was quite good but I was disappointed with the pizza. I had heard great things about their pizza but it was just disappointing.##food:-1~service:1~meat:1~ambiance:1
Sentence110##Literally my go to restaurant whether it's happy hour or brunch. Food is amazing & drinks are always great.##food:1~drinks:1
Sentence111##Nice atmosphere but service was just horrible. We were seated right away, but it only took over 20 minutes for the waiter to come to us. I had to forcibly make eye contact with him because he was over talking or what seemed to be more like flirting with the girl who worked at the front of the door who sat us down and he still acted like he couldn't see us. The worse part of it all, was that the place was pretty much empty! When he finally decided to walk over after we were borderline about to walk out, he then asked us if we wanted anything to drink. We could not have taken the chance of him leaving again so we just asked for water and gave him our order.##service:-1~ambiance:1
Sentence112##Love this place but the last 3 times we've ordered they have messed up the order.  Salad was sent with wrong ingredients, chicken cheesesteak was sent with only meat even though menu listed peppers, onions and cheese.  We tried one more time and even relisted ingredients in the notes and it was still sent wrong.  Such a shame because the food is good.##food:1~service:-1
Sentence113##First time we ordered, the pizza was great. Ordered again last night and the bottom of the pizza was burnt. 3 stars because I paid $14.00 for burnt pizza.##food:1~service:-1
Sentence114##Visiting after 2 years I have to say that their food has improved significantly! The mozzarella and tomato salad was delicious and fresh. Their pizza is also delicious. We got the pepperoni pizza and the sauce and bread was very fresh. We also ordered the Coletti burger and is was very tasty. The beef was juicy and delicious!.##food:1~meat:1
Sentence115##Ordered a large pizza along with few side dishes for delivery from this restaurant for the first time last weekend for dinner. The food came in an hour and half later at 9:40pm and the pizza was cold. One of the side dishes calamari and shrimp salad was loaded with salt. The pizza was good after being reheated. You are better off eating at the restaurant instead getting the pizza delivered.##food:1~service:-1
Sentence116##Terrible Service. Over Priced Food. Low Quality Food. Dark Atmosphere to seem cool and mask all the other terrible stuff.##food:-1~service:-1~ambiance:1
Sentence117##Their food is rather good, not a competition to many local restaurants. I would not say that price to quality ratio is good. The service leaves more to desire. Also it attracts a certain type of crowed that you don't necessarily want to be around. And it gets particularly bad at night. It's main advantage is convenient location.##food:1~service:-1
Sentence118##Our pizza delivered just fine. 45 mins after we placed the order via Yelp. The pizza was delicious. Def will bookmark this restaurant for a long time!##food:1~service:1
Sentence119##Went in last night after work to meet up with my girlfriends. They were really accommodating to my group of 6. At the time there wasn't that many people inside but a good amount, perfect for us to drink and eat and catch up. The food was ok. I ordered the calamari on happy hour which were really good with the spicy mayo. My soror ordered some pizza she said was delicious. They also have truffle fries which I love. The bartender taking care of us was a really nice girl who did a really great job at taking all of our orders. Overall I am very pleased with the place and def plan to return.##food:1~service:1~people:1
Sentence116##I held my 21st bday here at VB3... The steak and mashed potatoes were amazing. Since it was my 21st, my first drink was on them.  Friendly staff and very accommodating. We had a really great time here.##food:1~service:1~meat:1~people:1

Sentence119##I like this place, but not everything on the menu is good. Aroncini rice balls were good. Pizza slices were good (tasted like something from a good place across the river.) The "asianey" stuff, not so good. Watch our foe drunks trying to sleep it off in the "boothey" area near the windows during the day.##food:1
Sentence120##Went here for happy hour and the food was pretty decent. I wasn't a fan of the wings, but the pizza was definitely delicious. Their happy hour menu has decent pricing. Overall had a good experience and our waitress was really attentive.##food:1~people:1~price:1

Called them back ten minutes later and they said the food would be here any second. 20 minutes later the delivery staff called to say they would be here in 10 minutes as stuck in traffic. This restaurant is half a mile away from where I live. Still no food and they obviously messed up my order, wonder if it will ever turn up.##food:1~service:-1
Sentence134##This is one of my favorite Indian restaurants in Jersey City. My boyfriend and I came here for our anniversary and food was delicious.

I love coming to this restaurant.##place:1~service:1~food:1
Sentence135##Pathetic food. Worst service ever. Not worth a single star. It took more than 20 mins for the menu to be headed over. We ordered appetizers and waited for another 10-15 mins. We wanted to place an order for the main course and asked a question about the food. The male server was very rude, we asked him about the delay in answering a basic question. His reply and the following dialogue was extremely rude. That chap should not be in service industry. While leaving we made sure that he heard what we thought about his service and attitude towards work. We left the place after waiting for 30 mins without eating. The ambiance was decent. But the server ruined it completely. We have ordered food from here in the past and it's not special. pathatic service standards.##ambiance:1~service:-1~food:-1~people:-1

Sentence138##I love this place. Their food is amazing, albeit it is bit on the pricey side. But their delivery service is just awful. Last night it took over 2 hours. Unfortunately, that wasn't just a one off occurrence. We keep trying as the food is great and we haven't found better nearby, but we've literally never had it take less 1 hour 15, and that's usually a 'good' day. I guess it would be ok if they said it was going to take so long, but the website always says 45 mins to an hour. So, I think we're going back on the hunt again, but if the delivery service ever improves, we'll try again!##place:1~food:1~price:-1~service:1
Sentence139##Staff were nice enough to allow us to sit in for food though the were closing in 40 min. I will say that there are better indian spots but this was pretty good. I had the chicken which was pretty good. Chicken was a bit dry but the best part was the plentiful and delicious coconut curry sauce it's served with. I also some of the eggplant dishes were good. Again didn't care for the eggplant, which I don't like anyway but the ginger sauce it came with was great. The naan bread was also great, delicious and hot. The waitstaff were nice throughout giving us extra rice and refilling our water.##food:1~service:1
Sentence140##I wish I could give this place more stars.  Unfortunately, I would not recommend this to someone who is craving Indian food or is wanting to try Indian food for the first time. because this is not what it is supposed to taste like.Definitely from a North Indians perspective, they missed the mark on the North Indian food.  I can't speak for the South Indian dishes (dosas etc) because we didn't try any of it. The most basic North Indian dish, dal tadka aka black lentils, had no flavour, was WAY too thick, and was just very disappointing. If you can't do a classic dish right, then we have problems. The mango lassi, which also a very basic drink, was also way too thick. The only dishes that were semi decent were the tandoori chicken and the biryani. Especially since Jersey City is known to have good quality indian food, this definitely was not up to par.##food:-1
Sentence141##Please do not order from Blue Lotus, especially for delivery! Quite frankly, the owner does not put their customer first. We have ordered delivery and pickup over half a dozen times. On average, the delivery was at least an hour to 90 minutes late. I could understand if they have occasional busy nights or have some temporary staffing issues. However, the extend of the delay is systemic and the owner is very rude and not concerned about customers' displeasure. Calling the them does not seem to help or add any urgency. They seems to treat complaint as annoyance rather than notes for improvement. Nearly two hours for two entrees are not acceptable and a quick look among reviews here confirms this is normal from Blue Lotus. They say customers come to a restaurant for food but return for good services. We would definitely not be back!##people:-1
Sentence142##Great little Indian cafe! Loved it. Food is amazing and full of flavor. Ordered spicy shrimp appetizer which we ate with a wheat style roti pancake. The shrimp was tender and moist - the roti was a nice contrasting texture.  Garlic Nan was a nice compliment to the curry. The Nan was puffy, flaky and slightly buttery. My Spicy Lamb dish was very good, i liked the curry so much i consumed every last drop of curry and used the nan to sop up any left over curry in the bowl!  Great new spot I found in jersey city.This was a small place with just 10 tables. Only negative was the service was slow seeing the place wasn't that busy however this could be the standard for this establishment. The taste of the food more than made up for the delay.##food:1~place:1
Sentence143##We had a lovely romantic dinner here. Food was good, reasonable, service was prompt, if not solicitous, and we really enjoyed it! There were families with children and tables of all adults. A great neighborhood find - we'll be back.##service:1~food:1
Sentence144##The food is pretty good. Spices and flavor are great. There's not much of a better Indian option around this area unless you head to Newark ave. but I do think the food is very overpriced. The food is good just not worth the price especially when so many places on Newark deliver.##food:1
Sentence145##The lamb, chicken, and spinach dishes are always amazing, of course being the CARBovore that I am, my favorite still being the soft fragrant naan.Do expect the food to take a long time to come out because they had told me everything is made to order, but trust me, well worth your wait. I've been here about 5 times now, and find that the service was better when it first opened compared to more recent months. Bottom line - Highly recommended Indian restaurant in downtown JC, the food takes about 40 minutes to come out but well worth the wait.##food:1
Sentence146##Unfortunately I have to update this review with a recent negative experience with delivery. We ordered at 7pm on a Friday night. Called around 8:20 when food was still not here. They assured us it was "on the way." Called again around 8:45, same thing. Offered a 25% discount and resisted when we asked to cancel the order. 9:15 rolls around, we've already eaten something else, we call to cancel and they finally agree to cancel our order. Then the buzzer rings! The delivery guy then offers a 20% discount and we tell him to please refund our money.So I get if you are busy, its a Friday night, but over 2 hours for delivery is never acceptable. The worst part was lying to us, saying it's on the way when clearly it was not. I won't be ordering from here again, even though the food was good when I've had it in the past.##food:1~service:-1
Sentence147##Worst service for deliver. They hung up on us twice when we called asking for an update on food. False promise of food delivery over 90 minutes! Not worth it.##service:-1~ambience:1
Sentence148##So, I was thinking, yay new indian restaurant close to me I decide to pay a visit and alas. This place is ghetto. Pages of the menu stapled together, hmmm thats not how menus should be if you are charging me freaking $15 for a tasteless paneer tikka!!! I wasn't sure who my server was, there was a young girl running franticly eveywhere trying to be everybody's server. We waited for our tasteless food for good 20 minutes, mind you i only ordered one entree and a paneer tikka. Makhni daal tasted burnt and was so garlicky, it could burn nostril hair. $48 went down the drain, received poor service and tasteless food.Never going back.##food:-1~service:-1~place:-1
Sentence149##This is a review of the food from their booth at the hamilton park farmers market. I've ordered their chicken tikka combo multiple times. The first time, the portion was large and the combo came with a salad and 2 naan. The last few times, the woman server gave me 3 tiny pieces of chicken on a skimpy bed of rice, no salad and 1 naan. When I asked for more chicken, she added 1 piece. It was not enough to constitute a decent dinner. Also the last few times, when I wasn't paying attention to her putting my order together, she failed to give me any sauce for my samosa. I get the impression that they are being stingy and it's very off putting. They miscalculate the price frequently. The last time, I ended up with some serious stomach problems as well. I say avoid, avoid! Very bad restuarant.##place:-1
Sentence150##The food is over rated and definitely no where closer to what Indian food should be. Service was horrible, had to wait for 45 min before the order arrived at the table. Fish served was raw, chicken was burnt. I am done with this place.##food:-1~service:-1
Sentence151##Terrible Service. Over Priced Food. Low Quality Food. Dark Atmosphere to seem cool and mask all the other terrible stuff.##food:-1~service:-1~ambiance:1
Sentence152##In a county filled with Caribbean restaurants, you really can't beat this place. All Puerto Rican restaurants I've been to are alright, but leave a lot to be desired. This place saved my pregnancy cravings and then some. If only they made Puerto Rican potato salad.... Hint hint. But really amazing food, I will be ordering catering for my sons communion next month and can't wait for everyone to try it. Plus they sell pasteles to take home. Let me tell you, I'm not a fan of pasteles in general but I really enjoyed theirs.##food:1
Sentence153##Sigh. I really wanted to love this place. The reviews raved about the food, the service and the location but this place just didn't do it for me. For starters, the place is very small and quaint. I counted 5 tables for two, and three tables for 4. Very cozy and intimate but this place is definitely not a place for groups. The server was very friendly but he was very pushy in the beginning to get our order in, only to turn around and let our drinks run out later on. The food.... Sigh. This was the biggest let down. We ordered the empanadas, which were OK but lacked the authenticity I was looking for. We also ordered the pollo asado and the chuletas fritas. We chose maduros and arroz con guandules as our sides. The chicken was pretty good and came with a sauce that complimented it well. The pork chops were edible, although overcooked. The rice was the biggest disappointment of the night. As a native Puerto Rican, rice is eaten with almost all of our traditional meals and is a staple in our culture. The rice served at Me Casa didn't reflect that. The texture was off, and it was cold. I didn't taste the flavor and I could tell it was rushed. Because I am from the island, I respect PR owned and operated establishments and do my best to support them. However, the rice which should be a specialty lacked authenticity and I've had much better at cheap hole in the walls. So obviously, this left me disappointed. I wish I would have walked out of here jumping up and down excited to go back, but that simply wasn't the case. Probably won't be returning.##food:-1~service:-1~meat:1~place:-1
Sentence154##Came here for a relatively early dinner on a Friday night. So it wasn't packed/ not too busy. Got served right away. I must say their service is beyond amazing - just insanely nice and courtesy and pleasant! Our server Matt was great and very nice but just every employee sounded so happy from the interactions we could hear at other tables. Got the ceviche, esliders, and house pork dish. Everything tastes really great. Ceviche presentation was different - came in little cups of plantains. At the end of the meal the chef or someone with chef jacket came around and asked us about our experience and offered free dessert for our thoughts - so sweet. We didn't take him up on the offer (so full) but just the gesture was real nice. Overall great first experience and will be back! Thanks for the awesome dinner and experience!##food:1~service:1~people:1
Sentence155##Shrimp was so good. Love the source for fried plantain -garlic and oil. It was my first time to try this kind of food. Stew source s delicious. Good service as well.##service:1~meat:1
Sentence156##This small restaurant is excellent. The staff is phenomenal, they greet you with a smile as you are walking through the door and always make sure you are well taken care of! Food was great even my 9 year old enjoyed it even tho there is no specific menu for kids he was able to make his own out of different choices. The best part was that my father in law enjoyed this little gem for his birthday.##food:1~service:1~people:1~place:1
Sentence157##Great food!! The mofongo is slamming and the cilantro sauce is on point!##food:1
Sentence158##I came here for my friends birthday. We got seated pretty quick, especially for a small place like that. The music is pretty loud where you can't hear each other talk sometimes. My favorite dishes were the beef monfongo and beef empanadas. I would definitely come back to try more of their options.##meat:1~music:-1
Sentence159##A cozy little spot that is nice for a downtown JC dinner date. A bit hidden and very modest from the outside, the downstairs room surprises once you open the door. Service is friendly and patient and it is BYOB, too, which is a plus if you come prepared (we didn't). Food was okay, but not amazing. The empanada sampler was a total letdown and was missing flavor. The pernil underwhelmed us, too, but the bistec and the asopao de camarones both got our thumbs up. Feels very local here, with nice energy and an appreciative staff.##food:-1~service:1~people:1
Sentence160##Im going to start off with the outstanding service Me Casa provides from management to waiter they make you feel at "home" they definitely go the extra mile to make sure your time there is exquisite. now to the food the best Spanish food in the the tri state area and thats a huge statement. favorite on the menu is the mofongo but you cant go wrong with anything on the menu i had the empanadas for appetizers they were fresh definitely home made. place is real small perfect for a romantic evening with your significant other. :)##food:1~service:1~people:1
Sentence161##First of all I would not classify this as a restaurant. When you see a floor cleaning mop and bucket and a bunch of brown boxes of plastic spoons in front of your dining table, that's not a restaurant for me. Service is slow. Really really slow. We were 2 and we ordered 1 started and 2 entrees. How difficult is it to get them in order. They came back with 2 entrees and got the started later. As a sorry they didn't charge us for the started. Well, thank you but you know where we are heading when you are confused by a 3 item order.##food:-1~service:-1~place:-1
Sentence162##I’d been meaning to check this place out for awhile after reading all the glowing Yelp reviews.  I've gotta say that the food is pretty tasty. I took my mom out for lunch and we both enjoyed our dishes. My mofongo was very authentic, as was her pernil (pork).  It's definitely comparable to what you might find over in Union City, without having to take the hike all the way over.  The two (minor) knocks I have are 1) the restaurant is tiny and slightly below ground level, and 2) the portions will leave you satisfied, but don't try to compare with any of the restaurants on Bergenline in Union City, where you'll have leftovers for days. Still, I found the restaurant charming in its own way, despite the cramped quarters, and I didn't think the prices were too outrageous considering the neighborhood, which probably helps explain portion controls.##food:1~place:1~price:1
Sentence163##I really wanted to love this place since I have yet to find a great latino (Caribbean) restaurant in Downtown Jersey City. Unfortunately, another one bites the dust. The restaurant is very cute and intimate inside.  I ordered take out for lunch. The service was pretty quick considering they had just opened at 11:30am. I was out by 11:50 and made it to my office by 11:56. All the food was packaged seperately, which I appreciated. I ordered the tilapia in mango sauce, with white rice and beans with a side order of tostones with mojito and a chicken empanada. The tilapia was gross. It was not fresh at all. It tasted like frozen fish. The mango "sauce" was not sauce but rather mango chunks with tomatos, cilantro and raw onions. Which is fine, but I was expecting a sauce to drizzle over the dry tilapia. The rice was cold and not fully cooked. It tasted old. The beans tasted ok but were semi cold too. I could tell both the rice and beans were just reheated and not made fresh. The tostones were ok as well as the mojito.  The empanada wasn't authentic caribbean style, but all in all, good. Overall, I was not impressed and don't think I'll be back.##food:-1~service:1 
Sentence164##Empanadas and platanos were over fried and the flavor of the rest of food was just banal. No decor and the only good thing was the service, although the restaurant was empty on Wednesday night.##food:-1~service:1~ambiance:-1
Sentence165##Loved the food especially the curry and empanadas are must try. The ambience is very cozy and the servers are very cooperative.##food:1~service:1~ambiance:1~people:1
Sentence166##I really have no basis of reference for  Puerto Rican food. PRO: The service was phenomenal, friendly, the owner enjoys interacting with you and loves answering questions. Quaint ambiance. PRO/CON: Expect a small dining room, below street level, casual family atmosphere (this could mean more interaction with your server, and perhaps more time to get your freshly prepared meal than you prefer). HINT: BYOB (the staff will point you to the closest liquor store).##food:1~ambiance:1
Sentence167##Fun dinner at ME Casa on Thursday night. We had a Groupon,  and it was definitely worth it. The food is a gourmet take on traditional Puerto Rican cuisine. We started with the calamari  appetizer, which came with a spicy dipping sauce. I had the pork chops with a side of yucca con mojito. My husband had chicken mofongo with a side of rice & beans.  We also ordered maduros, since they're a favorite. No dessert, we were way too full and brought home about half of our food. The food is very good, pricier than the usual Caribbean fare, but worth it. The restaurant is byob. Our bill before the Groupon discount was 50.00. Definitely worth trying. The place is small, though, so go early or make a reservation. Service was really great.##food:1~service:1~place:-1~price:-1
Sentence168##What can I say?  This place is flat out amazing.  Tucked away in a basement type restaurant off the strip in Downtown Jersey City but deserving of every accolade that it receives.  We arrived on a Wednesday night and were promptly seated, then the fun began.  The mufongo sampler is a must for anyone who has not tried it before.  Any of the entrees are winners, just depends on your mood.  The real seal of approval came from the service and the staff.  Chef Eddie came out and was warm and welcoming...our server was kind and professional at the beginning then transitioned into more friendly as the night went along.  Will be returning to see what else this JC establishment has to offer.##food:1~service:1~place:1

Sentence172##I came to 15 Fox Place for my dad's birthday and sat in the dining room on the first floor. As soon as we walked in we were graciously welcomed by Michelle who was our server for the evening. The ambiance is very warm and cozy and the food was delicious. My favorite dish was the polenta which was incredibly creamy and flavorful. I also enjoyed the cannoli cream dessert! Definitely the place to go for a special occasion for delicious home cooked italian food! Exceptional service in a unique setting with outstanding food! What more can you ask for from this extraordinary place!##food:1~service:1~place:1
Sentence173##I thoroughly enjoyed the food here. I thought the flavor, presentation, and combinations were great. Very fresh and well prepared. The service was also great. The downside was that for small sizes the price is rather high. I would also like to see more vegan friendly options here. They have an extensive drink menu as well, which I would be interested in trying during another visit. The music was fun and I liked the atmosphere. You could either sit at the bar or at some shared tables along the wall.##food:1~service:1~ambiance:1~presentation:1~music:1
Sentence174##Everything about this place is done well. The cocktails are always changing and the wine choices are great. The bartenders are always knowledgeable and make great suggestions if you only have a vague idea of what you want. The food is delicious. I cannot get enough of the escabeche or the deviled eggs. The meats and cheeses are similarly excellent. We typically pick a couple meats and let them choose cheeses that will go well. We're yet to be steered wrong.## food:1~meat:1~place:1
Sentence175##This place is amazing! I am so happy I found this little gem. Service was great, food was amazing! We ordered the meatballs, Mac-n-cheese, and omg you have to order the bacon cheesecake! It was the best cheesecake I ever had!##food:1~service:1~place:1
